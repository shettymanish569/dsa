Approach:
1) Initializing the max and second max to the sallest value that is Integer.MIN_VALUE
2) Traverse the array once
3)  Track the max value and secondMax value
4)  Updating the max and second max based on the if and else if condition
5)  For the edge case if there is no second unique element then it will return -1

Sample Input:
nums=[3,5,2,5,6,6,1]

Sample Output:
5
